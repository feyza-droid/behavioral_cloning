This repository contains behavior cloning codebase. 

The collected data has 3 different behavior policies: 
    default_model.csv contains data collected while evaluating an RL agent
    training_model.csv contains data collected while training an RL agent
    idm.csv contains data collected by an rule-based autopilot

Since data is big, it is not uploaded here.

The simulator used is called SimStar and it belongs to Eatron company. It is a part of my research work.
